# US-Census-Demographic-Data-Visualization
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the [census data for all counties in 2015](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data).
In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a Kaggle dataset. I created data visualizations that tell a highlight patterns in the data set.

## Insight 1 (tree maps)

**Summary**

for this Tree maps, we can see mean time of commutation in every state. It appears that New Jersey 30.06 minutes spent in commuting across all transportationâ€™s methods.

**Design**

I chose Tree maps design because it is visually attractive and can determine which states suffers from time consumed in transportations.

## Insight 2 (Horizontal Bars)

https://public.tableau.com/views/races_16521329403970/races?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

**Summary**

from this visualization, we can determine races numbers in each country/state and know where each race has the most populations. Most Asian people settle in Hawaii. Most Black people settle in District of Colombia. *Note-- District of Colombia is a small state has a low population so it might be ignored and pick 2nd state Mississippi. Most Hispanic people settle in Puerto Rico. Most Pacific people settle in Hawaii. Most Native people settle in Alaska. Most white people settle in Maine.

**Design**
Horizontal bars is the most easy way to determine the highest and lowest across multiple set of data to determine which percentage is the highest and which one is the 
lowest.

## Insight 3 (dashboard)

https://public.tableau.com/views/dashboard_16521344937980/popandincomevspoverty?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

**Summary**

this dashboard covers multiple insight between income and population and poverty including child poverty for each country/state.

**Design**

I chose map cause it looks perfect to determine population visually and connect the place(country) to its population directly.
