# US-Census-Demographic-Data-Visualization
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it includes the [census data for all counties in 2015](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data).
In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a Kaggle dataset. I created data visualizations that tell a highlight patterns in the data set.
